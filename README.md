# Recurtilisation_Web
![The word "Recurtilisation", which is the game's title, in Endor. This is the same image used for the title screen in-game.](data/Title_408_108.png)
A short, chill clicker game made for KiwiJam 2023, with a theme of "Growth".
Recurtilisation is built around a barperpole-like illusion of motion to show the plant "growing upwards".
